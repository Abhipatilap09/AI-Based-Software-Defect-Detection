     - Kurtosis analysis: WMC>3 motivates ensembles
   ✓ Data characteristics per class: Defective vs clean comparison

   Location: Datasets section - Data Exploration subsection (lines 223-250)

B. Data Preprocessing & Preparation
   ✓ 5-step process detailed:

     2. Feature transformation (log, formula specified)
     3. Outlier handling (retained >3σ, rationale given)
     4. Categorical encoding (one-hot)

B. Results of Evaluation
   ✓ ANT-1.7 (Balanced Data):
     - Table 1: 4 models × 7 metrics (Acc, Prec, Rec, F1, AUC, Spec, PF)
     - Best: RF AUC 0.836 vs LR 0.814 (2.2% improvement)
     - Quantitative comparison: RF recall 0.788 vs LR 0.697 (9.1% delta)
   
   ✓ ROC Curves (ANT-1.7):
     - 4 models plotted with empirical coordinates
     - RF steep initial rise identified
     - Operating point comparison: FPR 0.241 → TPR RF 0.788 vs LR 0.697
   
   ✓ Confusion Matrix (ANT-1.7):
     - TP=26, FP=34, TN=82, FN=7
     - Cost analysis: (26×10) - (34×1) = 226 hours net benefit
     - ROI: 22.6 hours overhead per ~260 reviews
   
   ✓ Camel-1.0 (Extreme Imbalance):
     - Test set: only 3 defects in 68 samples
     - Performance paradox: AUC 0.856 > ANT 0.836, but utility lower
     - RF precision collapse: 0.107 (93% false positives)
     - Cost-benefit reveals NB superior: 8 hrs vs RF 5 hrs ROI
   
   ✓ GHPR (Data Quality Issues):
     - All models AUC=1.0 flagged as anomalous
     - Diagnostic hypotheses: perfect separation, label corruption, leakage
     - Validation recommendations: audit labels, check engineering, temporal split

     2. LCOM: 0.15
     3. CBO: 0.12
     4. LOC: 0.10
     5. WMC: 0.09
   ✓ Theoretical grounding: Coupling+Cohesion=45% (validates Chidamber 1994)
   ✓ Interpretation: High coupling/complexity → defects
   ✓ Dimensionality insight: Bottom-5 metrics (0.01-0.03) contribute minimally

D. Further Experimental Analysis: Ablation Study
   ✓ Baseline (no SMOTE, no weights): AUC 0.814
   ✓ + Class Weights only: AUC 0.823 (+0.9%)
   ✓ + SMOTE only: AUC 0.819 (+0.5%)
   ✓ + SMOTE + Class Weights: AUC 0.836 (+2.2%, F1 +4.2%, Recall +6.1%)
   ✓ Conclusion: Class weights dominate, weighted sampling effective

   ✓ Three operating points documented:
     - Aggressive (0.3): Sensitivity 0.867, Specificity 0.626
     - Balanced (0.5): Sensitivity 0.788, Specificity 0.707
     - Conservative (0.7): Sensitivity 0.636, Specificity 0.843
